###Activity 3

##Objectives
* 	to understand the concept of branches
*	be able to create a new branch
*	be able to view all branches/current branch
*	be able to switch branches
*	be able to merge a feature branch into master
*	be able to delete a branch



1.	View the current branch 

git branch

2.	Create a new branch

git branch feature/header

3. Check the branch is created successfully  - should show both branches. A star indicates the active branch.

git branch

4.	Switch to the new branch - should see a change in the shell output, the active branch is shown in brackets

git checkout feature/header

5. Create a new file on the feature/header branch

touch header.html
git status

6. Add the file to the staging area

git add header.html
git status

7. Commit the file - header.html should no longer show as a new file

git commit -m "Adding header.html"
git status

8. Switch back to the master branch and check the contents

git checkout master
git status

9.	Merge the feature/header branch into master, then list the files. Header.html now exits in the the master branch.

git merge feature/header
ls


10.	View your commit history 

git log

11. Delete the feature/header branch, then check the branch listing

git branch -d feature/header
git branch
